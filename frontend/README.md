# Appointment System Testing Guide

## Phase 1: Local Proof of Concept ‚úÖ

The appointment system has been successfully implemented with localStorage persistence! Here's how to test it:

## Quick Test Instructions

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Test Dashboard

- Open the dashboard page
- **No demo appointments** - dashboard will be empty initially
- Create appointments first (see step 3) to see them appear here
- **New clean list design** - no images, just name, description, appointment type, and time

### 3. Test Creating New Appointments

#### Via Patient Page:

1. Go to "Patients" page
2. Select any patient from the list
3. Click "Afspraken" tab
4. Click "Nieuwe afspraak" button
5. **The description field now works!** ‚úÖ
6. Fill in:
   - Description (e.g., "Controle afspraak")
   - Date & time (set for future)
   - Category (from dropdown)
7. Click "Toevoegen"
8. The appointment appears in the calendar
9. Go back to Dashboard - your new appointment should appear in the clean list!

### 4. Test Patient Navigation from Dashboard

- Create an appointment for a patient
- Go to Dashboard
- **Click on the patient name** in the appointment list
- You'll navigate directly to that patient's overview page
- See their **data and graphs** (CMAS scores, lab results)
- Notice the "Afspraak: [type]" badge showing which appointment you clicked from
- Use the "‚Üê Dashboard" button to go back

### 5. Test Data Persistence

- Create appointments
- Refresh the page or restart the app
- Appointments should still be there! (localStorage)

## What's Working

‚úÖ **Description field fixed** - You can now type in the appointment description  
‚úÖ **Local persistence** - Appointments survive page refresh  
‚úÖ **Patient-specific appointments** - Each patient has their own appointments  
‚úÖ **Clean list design** - Simple, professional appointment list (no images)  
‚úÖ **Real patient navigation** - Click patient name ‚Üí see their data/graphs  
‚úÖ **Appointment context** - Shows which appointment you clicked from dashboard  
‚úÖ **Real-time updates** - Create appointment ‚Üí immediately visible everywhere

## New Features

### üé® **Redesigned Dashboard**

- **Clean list format** instead of card layout
- Shows: Patient name, description, appointment type, date/time
- **No images** - cleaner, more professional look
- **Hover effects** and smooth transitions
- **Icons** for date and time for better UX

### üîó **Improved Navigation**

- **Click patient name** ‚Üí Go directly to patient overview with data/graphs
- **Appointment context** - See which appointment brought you there
- **Back to dashboard** button when navigated from appointments
- **Tab switching** between patient data and appointments

### üìä **Patient Data Integration**

- **Real Strapi patient data** instead of hardcoded data
- **CMAS charts** integration
- **Lab results** with interactive selection
- **Full patient workflow** maintained

## Features Implemented

### Appointment Service (`appointmentService.ts`)

- Create appointments linked to patients
- Retrieve appointments by patient
- Get all upcoming appointments
- localStorage persistence
- Delete/update appointments

### Updated Dashboard

- Shows real upcoming appointments instead of fake data
- **Clean list design** with patient name, description, type, time
- **Clickable patient names** navigate to patient data/graphs
- Auto-refreshes every minute
- Shows "no appointments" state when empty

### Enhanced Patient Overview

- **Fetches real patient data** from Strapi
- **Full CMAS and lab results integration**
- **Appointment context** from dashboard navigation
- **Tab switching** between data and appointments views

### Updated Patient Calendar

- Integrates with appointment service
- Patient-specific appointment viewing
- Real appointment creation and storage

## Data Structure

Appointments are stored in localStorage with this structure:

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  patientId: 123,
  patientName: "Patient Name",
  title: "Appointment Title",
  description: "Description text",
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
  category: "Category Name",
  status: "scheduled",
  createdAt: Date
}
```

## Usage Workflow

1. **Create Appointments**: Patients page ‚Üí Select patient ‚Üí Afspraken tab ‚Üí Nieuwe afspraak
2. **View on Dashboard**: All upcoming appointments appear in clean list
3. **Navigate to Patient**: Click patient name ‚Üí See their data, graphs, and appointment context
4. **Manage Appointments**: Switch to appointments tab to see calendar view

## Next Steps (Future: Strapi Integration)

When ready to migrate to Strapi:

1. Create Appointment content type in Strapi
2. Replace `localStorage` calls with `axios` API calls
3. Same interface, different implementation
4. Zero changes to UI components

## Troubleshooting

**No appointments showing on dashboard?**

- Dashboard starts empty (no demo appointments)
- Create appointments via Patients ‚Üí Afspraken tab ‚Üí Nieuwe afspraak
- Set appointment time in the future to see on dashboard

**Description field not working?**

- ‚úÖ This has been fixed! The name attribute now matches the onChange handler

**Patient navigation not working?**

- Make sure you're clicking on the **patient name** in the appointment list
- Check that the patient exists in Strapi
- Look for error messages in browser console

**Want to reset data?**

- Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí localStorage
- Delete the "appointments" key
- Refresh page
